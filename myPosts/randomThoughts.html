            Thought on loading data from ply file
        </h1>
        Idk why but I was doing the dishes one day and the thought came to me; I could load a ply file by loading the then bit shifting it into the correct variables.
        <br>
        Then I thought; why don't I try copying the entire line, then copying parts at a time!???
        <br>
        Then I relised memcpy, and structs exist
