      <h1> My Expereince Writting an ECS system</h1>
      Writting an ECS system was hard and confusing.

      <h3> Variants </h3>
      At first I was going to use std::variants, and use that to hold the objects. In fact I went all the way through, and implemented them. But then I relised, that, I cannot change the values in a variant without entirely remaking the object. Now, this ecs system doesn't need to be fast. My needs just need fast read/write. But this was gonna be too slow. So I threw it out.

      <h3> Raw pointers </h3>
      Im writting this in c++, so no.

      <h3> unique_ptrs </h3>
      Why did I make this unique? Idk. I wanted everyone to have access to just one pointer, so I dont accidently leave something allocated uk. In the end this is what I went with. The method I used for loading data is something to be studied, and I'll probs discuss it late LMAO.
