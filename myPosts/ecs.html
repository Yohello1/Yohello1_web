      <h1> My Expereince Writting an ECS system</h1>
      Writting an ECS system was hard and confusing.

      <h3> Variants </h3>
      At first I was going to use std::variants, and use that to hold the objects. In fact I went all the way through, and implemented them. But then I relised, that, I cannot change the values in a variant without entirely remaking the object. Now, this ecs system doesn't need to be fast. My needs just need fast read/write. But this was gonna be too slow. So I threw it out.

      <h3> Raw pointers </h3>
      Im writting this in c++, so no.

      <h3> unique_ptrs </h3>
      Why did I make this unique? Idk. I wanted everyone to have access to just one pointer, so I dont accidently leave something allocated uk. In the end this is what I went with. The method I used for loading data is something to be studied, and I'll probs discuss it late LMAO.

      <h3>Maps</h3>
      So in the end my ecs system ended up just being a map with some extra functions (very useful functions). Really all the heavy lifting is done by a map lmao. I need to actually change its key to smth better, as a string aint that great lmaoo. <br>
      Anywaysss, there are like 3 types of maps fof the top of my head. Ordered map(default in c++), unordered, and unordered_dense. You can read into the semantics of each one yourself,, its not worth the space here whilst other people have written so much more, and better stuff. <br>
      If you need to choose between these three, ask yourself these questions; how many elements will be there, how much memory, speed use. <br>
      Map uses a lot less memory than both unordered_map, and unordered_dense(generally since there isnt anything in the c++ standard yet), this is espectially true at low elements amounts. <br>
      From there I just ask myself do I actually need the speed benifits, and will they be visible. <br>
      Unless Im doing like over 1k entities, I dont bother using anything other than map.

      <h3>Type_info/type_index</h3>
      Type_info returns like a hash on the type of class or wtvvv, I realllyyy like it. BUt make sure to know when to use type_index instead. As type_info returns a ptr which in a lot of situations is NOT what you want, whilst type_index returns data or smth. Basically,, use type_index when possible, I think, there are a lot of nuances. <br>
      Reminds me that I should learn about decltype.

      <h3>lvalues, and rvalues</h3>
      At some point search them up, they kinda just make sense.
