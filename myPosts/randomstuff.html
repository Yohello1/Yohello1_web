<h1> SSH Tricks </h1>

<h2>Proxy</h2>

Recently I learned that we could ssh proxy, previously I was using tailscale and a vps on cloud.csclub.uwaterloo.ca
But then Leo,  told me that I could just use `ssh -D`, which basically sets it up like a proxy server. You can search up the documentation

<h1> Git tricks </h1>

<h2> Depth </h2>
If you just need to build smth from souce, and need the code, and are ok with a shallow clone. Adding `--depth 1` can help quite a bit. Since it just tells git to get a shallow history, not EVERYTHING

<h2> git add * </h2>
Adds everything, except for things with a `.` infront of it... mostlyyy


<h1> sudo </h1>
<h2> When you get screwed </h2>
If you fuck up your dns, and network enough, sudo stops working

<h1>Compiling for embedded</h1>
<h2>unknown-elf (or none-elf) vs linux-gnu </h2>
If you know what these mean, yous hould know what what I'm about to say. <br>

So you should genreally try to use linux-gnu, not because it links against linux, but because it specifies the calling convention. The unknown/none-elf compiler stuff dont specify what the calling convention is, which makes it impossible to write programs that work with eachtoher.
